        Ferreñafe is a city in the Lambayeque Region in northern Perú. It is the
        capital of the Ferreñafe Province. It is located 30 km east of the city
        of Chiclayo. The city was founded on December 13, 1550 by captain Alonso
        de Osorio. An early civilization lived in this area, The Sican culture,
        which was a pre-Inca culture that built pyramids and buried their family
        lineage in forms that attract scholars from different fields of study.
        Here we have unique gastronomy, and ingredients such as Loche and
        Lucuma.
