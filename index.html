        Ferreñafe is a city in the Lambayeque Region in northern Perú. It is the capital of the Ferreñafe Province. 
        It is located 30 km east of the city of Chiclayo. The city was founded on December 13, 1550 by captain Alonso de Osorio.
        An early civilization lived in this area, The Sican culture, which was a pre-Inca culture that built pyramids and buried 
        their family lineage in forms that attract scholars from different fields of study.  Here we have unique gastronomy, and 
        ingredients such as Loche and Lucuma.
